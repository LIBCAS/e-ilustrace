/**
 * Bucket aggregations donâ€™t calculate metrics over fields like the metrics aggregations do, but instead, they create
 * buckets of documents. Each bucket is associated with a criterion (depending on the aggregation type) which determines
 * whether or not a document in the current context "falls" into it. In other words, the buckets effectively define
 * document sets. In addition to the buckets themselves, the {@code bucket} aggregations also compute and return the
 * number of documents that "fell into" each bucket.
 * <p>
 * Bucket aggregations, as opposed to {@code metrics} aggregations, can hold sub-aggregations. These sub-aggregations
 * will be aggregated for the buckets created by their "parent" bucket aggregation.
 * <p>
 * There are different bucket aggregators, each with a different "bucketing" strategy. Some define a single bucket, some
 * define fixed number of multiple buckets, and others dynamically create the buckets during the aggregation process.
 *
